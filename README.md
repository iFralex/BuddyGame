# BuddyGame
BuddyGame is a very basic platformer created with Unity, allowing players to move forward, backward, and jump. It lacks elements like an end goal, a user interface, enemies, or lives, making it a straightforward experience. This project is the result of one of my students' work after 12 hours of attending my game development course at my school.

I believe that with 12 hours of Unity instruction, a student could learn much more than what this example represents. Unfortunately, I made several teaching mistakes, especially considering it was my first teaching experience. These errors include:
- Assuming that the learning approach that worked for me with Unity would be equally effective for all students.
- Failing to account for the time lost in assisting students with basic and assumed computer operations, overestimating their experience with PC use.
- Planning a total time frame that didn't consider unexpected issues, ultimately proving insufficient.

This experience allowed me to recognize and learn from these mistakes, fostering personal growth and helping me move away from a somewhat individualistic perspective.
